Usage: xfds run [OPTIONS] [FDS_FILE] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Run an FDS in a Docker container.

Arguments:
  [FDS_FILE]  The FDS file or directory to run. If a **FDS file** is
              specified, the FDS model will run. If a **directory** is
              specified, xFDS will find the first FDS file in the directory
              and assume that is what it should run. If no fds file exists,
              xFDS will default to interactive mode. if **nothing** is
              specified, the current directory is used and the above rules are
              applied.   [default: .]

Options:
  -i, --interactive               Launch Docke-r container in interactive mode
                                  (`docker run -it`). By default, the Docker
                                  image will run the FDS model, but
                                  interactive mode will put you into the
                                  container where you can start the FDS model
                                  manually. This is good for when you are
                                  rapidly iterating and don't want to wait for
                                  the Docker image load time.
  -n, --processors INTEGER RANGE  Specify number of processors. If the number
                                  of processors is greater than 1, it will
                                  invoke MPI for you (`mpiexec -n #`). Ignored
                                  if interactive mode is enabled.   [default:
                                  1; x>=1]
  -v, --fds TEXT                  Specify FDS version to use. The FDS version
                                  can also be extracted from the file path or
                                  metadata in the FDS file.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
